# dot(n)vim

My **neovim** configuration.
The repo is called dotvim because of historic reasons. Maybe I am renaming it someday.

## Installation

1.) Install nvim nightly and this repo.
 
```bash
cargo install bob-nvim
bob install nightly
git clone git@github.com:geratheon/dotvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

2.) Go edit some text.
